Create a React/TS app that fetches a random word from the [API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) and displays it to the user.

##### Minimum requirements:

- Write everything in the `App()` function
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) as necessary
- Declare types as necessary
- Set an initial word on mount
- Provide a button for the user to get a new word
- Display a loading state while new words are fetched

##### Extras:

- Allow the user to specify word length
- Style the app using either CSS or CSS-in-JS
